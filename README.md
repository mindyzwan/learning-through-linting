# Learning Through Linting
## Description
Knowing how to use a code linter is simultaneously important and unimportant in the world of coding. It can teach you new skills, save time, help you land that coveted job, and lead to a more harmonious team — or not. We’ll discuss why and how in this interactive workshop, and walk through the installation and use of a popular JavaScript linter: ESLint. Active participation is highly encouraged, but not required if you prefer to just watch. We’ll be working in JavaScript and using Visual Studio Code.

## Objectives
Participants will be able to...
- add ESLint to a project
- configure ESLint rules
- use VS Code to highlight ESLint errors

## How to Start
Clone this repo to your personal computer and open in Visual Studio Code.
